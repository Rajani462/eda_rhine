#Explorerâ€™s Questions Answers

1.How big is the Rhine catchment (km2)?
Ans: 185,000 km2

2.If it rained for one full day over the whole catchment area at 5mm/hour and all the precipitated water ended up in the river, how much would be the increase in the average river runoff?
Ans:2,54,629.62 m3/sec.

runoff <- 


4.
a.Which other hydroclimatic changes reported in the article and not discussed above?
Ans:Temperature, Precipitation, Evapotranspiration and Snow melt/accumulation

b.Can you detect three assumptions made by Middelkoop et al. (2001)?

Ans:1.The models will provide reliable results under changed boundary conditions (climate, land use),though this cannot be proven by observations.

2.The input data particularly, rainfall considered uniform across the basin.
3.Alll the models performed well for the area and at the resolution they were designed for.

c.Why Middelkoop and his colleagues made this study? Why is it important? For example, the reason for searching for a way to the Orient was that Ottoman Empire monopolized the trade routes across Asia.

Ans:Theriver is of great economic and environmental importance for the riparian countries.

d.Are there other studies that have a similar analysis over Rhine, or a similar hypothesis in other regions? (hint: use google scholar or web of science/scopus)

Ans: Yes.

e. Is there any evidence in the news about low or high flow events of Rhine since 2000?
